# PyBer_Analysis

## Finding from pyber_summary_df
Urban cities have 30 times more drivers than rural cities and suburban cities have 6 times more drivers than rural cities .  But urban cities' total fare is just 9 times more than rural cities and suburban cities is 4 times more than rural cities. The return (total fare) on investment (driver count) doesn't look too good in urban cities. Also, the count of rides per driver is only 0.68 in urban cities; while it is 1.60 for rural drivers and 1.28 for suburban drivers. It seems there are too many Pyber drivers in urban cities. It may be better if the driver count is reduced in urban cities so that urban drivers can have more business to survive and Pyber may have better return on investment in urban cities. On the other hand, if possible, it better to increase driver count in rural cities to lower the average fare per ride so that people may be more willing to take Pyber rides and thus more business for Pyber in rural cities.

## Finding from Total Fare by City Type line chart
There is no obvious pike in any given time in the line chart. The total fare trend per month from Jan to May is similar for all three city types.
